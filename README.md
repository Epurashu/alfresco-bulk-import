# Alfresco Bulk Import Tool

**Please note that currently this is a *WORK-IN-PROGRESS* project supporting the
development of version 2 of the Alfresco Bulk Import Tool (formerly known as the
Alfresco Bulk Filesystem Import Tool).  If you're looking for documentation,
binaries etc. for the GA 1.x versions of the tool, please see the
[v1.x project](https://github.com/pmonks/alfresco-bulk-filesystem-import).**

## What Is It?
A high performance bulk import tool for the open source [Alfresco Document
Management System](http://www.alfresco.org/).

This module provides a bulk import process that will load content into the
repository from a variety of pluggable sources (a directory on the server's
local filesystem being the default source).  It will (optionally) replace
existing content items if they already exist in the repository, but does _not_
perform deletes (ie. this module is _not_ designed to fully synchronise the
repository with the source).

The module provides facilities for loading both metadata and version histories
for imported content, although note that Alfresco itself doesn't support version
histories for folders.

## What's New?
While work on v2.0 is in progress, you can monitor the
[commit log](https://github.com/pmonks/alfresco-bulk-import/commits/master) to
see what's going on.
For the GA v1.x versions of the tools, the
[Change Log](http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-bulk-filesystem-import/wiki/ChangeLog)
on Google Code has all the details.

 * [Design overview](http://blogs.alfresco.com/wp/pmonks/2009/10/22/bulk-import-from-a-filesystem/) (less relevant for v2.0+)
 * [DevCon 2011 presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/alfresco/taking-your-bulk-content-ingestions-to-the-next-level) (less relevant for v2.0+, but some good general findings on tuning Alfresco for I/O bound workloads such as bulk imports)

## Commercial Support
**This extension is not supported by [Alfresco Software Inc.](http://www.alfresco.com/)**,
although a fork of an early, pre-release version of the tool has been included in Alfresco
Enterprise since v4.0, and is supported by [Alfresco support](http://support.alfresco.com).

Please note that the embedded fork has never been rebased against upstream, meaning that it
is functionally equivalent to the 1.0-RC1 (circa mid-2010) version of the tool.  Its use
is therefore discouraged.
